In this workshop I learned to create a custom container class that
is in a composition relationship with another class. Since this 
class will contain an array of pointers, the rule of 5 (constructor, 
destructor, copy constructor/assignment, move constructor/assignment) 
had to be kept in consideration throughout this workshop. This workshop
also refreshed me on how to read lines from a file and parse them into
string objects based on some simple rules.
